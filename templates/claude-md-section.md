## Session Handoff

This project uses handoff-mcp for session continuity.

- **Session start**: Call `handoff_load_context` to load previous session state.
  If not initialized, call `handoff_init` with the project name.
  If `session_guidance` is present, immediately call `handoff_save_context`
  with `session_status: "active"` to establish a persistent session before
  starting work.
- **Session end**: Call `handoff_save_context` with a summary, decisions, and blockers.
- **During work**: Use `handoff_update_task` to track progress.
  Mark tasks `in_progress` when starting, `done` when complete.
